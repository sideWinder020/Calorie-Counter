NutriFact: A Food Nutrition Predictor
NutriFact is a FastAPI-based application that predicts the type of food from an uploaded image and provides its nutritional information using pre-trained machine learning models and the OpenAI API. The project is designed to help users quickly identify their food items and access important nutrition facts, such as calories, fat content, protein levels, and cholesterol.
